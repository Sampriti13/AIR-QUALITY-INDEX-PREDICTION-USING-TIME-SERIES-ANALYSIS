# AIR-QUALITY-INDEX-PREDICTION-USING-TIME-SERIES-ANALYSIS

In this project prediction and forecasting model for prediction and forecasting of the air quality index was developed with the help of Machine Learning (ML) techniques namely time series analysis. ARIMA (Auto regressive Integrated Moving Average) model and SARIMA (Seasonal Auto regressive Integrated Moving Average) has been used. Using Box-jerkins methodology and auto_arima, four different models were identified, ARIMA (1, 1, 2), ARIMA (0, 1, 1), ARIMA (1, 1, 1) and SARIMA (1, 0, 1) out of which ARIMA (1, 1, 2) outperforms the other three models. The model performance is evaluated using error metrics. The root mean square error (RMSE) value is 19.33, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 14.03, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 0.34. Using this algorithm predictions can be done which can provide valuable insights regarding the increase in air quality index to the policy makers.
